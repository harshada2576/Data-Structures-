# 📚 Data Structures in C

Welcome to my **Data Structures** repository! 👩‍💻  
This repository contains C programs implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms that are commonly studied in Computer Science curriculum.

Each program is written for educational purposes and includes comments to explain the logic. This repository can serve as a quick reference, learning resource, or even revision material for students.
